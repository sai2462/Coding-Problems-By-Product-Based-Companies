'''

Given an array of integers, return a new array such that each element at index i of the new array is the product of all the numbers in the original array except the one at i.

For example, if our input was [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], the expected output would be [120, 60, 40, 30, 24]. If our input was [3, 2, 1], the expected output would be [2, 3, 6].

# Python code:

lst=list(map(int,input().split()))
res=[]
n=len(lst)
p=1
for i in lst:
	p*=i
for i in range(n):
	res.append(p//lst[i])
print(res)
